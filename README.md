# BDLensing

This repository stores all the *HST* data, code, and notebooks for the 
BDLensing project.

Once you are assigned a lens system, please do the following:

1. Read `PROJECT.md` and create the 4 GitHub issues described in there.
2. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for instructions on how to fork this 
repository and provide code updates through pull requests.
3. Create a jupyter notebook in your local clone of the fork inside the 
directory of the lensing system assigned to you. This notebook is where 
you will do lens modeling. If you will be running the notebook on Google 
Colab, you will need to download that notebook time-to-time and sync it 
with this repo through pull requests.

You are only allowed to modify code files within the repository of your
lensing system. Only .ipynb and .py files are 
allowed to be created by you and added to this repository through pull 
requests. You are not allowed to modify the .h5 files. Make sure your pull 
requests do not add hidden files (e.g., .DS_Store) to the repository.
