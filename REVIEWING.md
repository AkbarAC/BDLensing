This is a guideline for reviewers of a pull request.

1. Go the PR page.
2. Click "Files changed".
3. Check if the PR has changed/added any files that should not have been changed/added. If it does, request to have that corrected. There can
be multiple ways within the PR page to request changes, for example, on the main thread on the PR's page, by clicking the text bubble button 
(**under** the green "Review changes" button), or if it's a .py file, you can click on the "+" symbol at the beginning of a specific line to 
insert a comment specific to that line.
5. Check if the newly added codes follow good coding practice, for example, PEP8, avoiding redundancies. If not, point those out to be fixed.
6. If you notice some code that can be rewritten to improve efficiency by a significant amount, request to make that improvement.
7. Once you are done viewing a file, click "Viewed" for that file. 
8. Once you are done viewing all the files, click "Review changes", choose between the three options: "Comment", "Approve", "Request changes" 
as appropriate.
9. Please don't merge and leave that to @ajshajib.
