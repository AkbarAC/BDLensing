## How to set up issues to aid project management

When you will be assigned a lens system to model, take a note of the lens 
systems's name that looks like "DESIJ0123+4567". Create the following four 
issues, but replace "DESIJ0123+4567" with your own system's name. You can 
open a new issue by clicking on the "Issues" tab on the top of the
repository page, and then clicking on the "New issue" button on the top-right
corner of the page. The issue descriptions are given below.

**After each issue is created, click on "+1 more" on the right panel 
under "Projects", and choose the following dates for "Target date":**

- Issue 1: 04/30/2023
- Issue 2: 06/10/2023
- Issue 3: 06/30/2023
- Issue 4: 07/30/2023
